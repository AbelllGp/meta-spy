## Info

If you're using a Facebook account with a custom ID in the URL (e.g., https://www.facebook.com/zuck), Facebook Spy will work smoothly. However, for accounts with default IDs in the URL, certain scrapers may not function as expected. These include scrapers for work and education, contact data, visited places, family members, recent places, reviews, and likes. Rest assured, we're actively working to resolve this issue

The difference, however, is that after scraping and creating Friend objects, it also creates objects for the CrawlerQueue model and after successfully scraping friends for one user, it proceeds to scraping the list of friends for the next user in the queue.
```bash
python main.py friend-crawler <facebook_id>
```
