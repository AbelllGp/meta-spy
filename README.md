## Info

If you're using a Facebook account with a custom ID in the URL (e.g., https://www.facebook.com/zuck), Facebook Spy will work smoothly. However, for accounts with default IDs in the URL, certain scrapers may not function as expected. These include scrapers for work and education, contact data, visited places, family members, recent places, reviews, and likes. Rest assured, we're actively working to resolve this issue

One notable limitation of the tool is that some scrapers may not work correctly for profiles with default account IDs in the URL, such as "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063142210972."

This command works similarly to the command that scrapes data about a given user's friends list. The difference, however, is that after scraping and creating Friend objects, it also creates objects for the CrawlerQueue model and after successfully scraping friends for one user, it proceeds to scraping the list of friends for the next user in the queue.
```bash
python main.py friend-crawler <facebook_id>
```
